Convert 497 to binary. Then, use two’s complement to convert 497 to -497 in binary.

Convert 900.79 to binary up to the 1/16ths spot.

Count from 0 through 10 in ternary (base 3). Note: the algorithm for counting is similar regardless of the number base. Show the place values.

Circuit design
Let A and B be two 2-bit binary numbers (i.e., A1 A0 and B1 B0). Write out a truth table for A less than or equal to B. For example,
0b10 is less than or equal to 0b11, so the output for that row should be true.

Write out the equivalent logic expression for the previous answer.

Write out the truth table for the minority circuit (it’s true when the minority of X, Y, and Z are true).

Write out the equivalent logic expression for the previous answer.

Boolean algebra
Use the laws of Boolean algebra.

Show c + (b * c)' = 1

Show (a + c) * (a * d + a * d') + a * c + c = a + c

Simplify a' * (a + b) + (b + a * a) * (a + b')

Show (a' * b') + (a' * b) + (a * b') = (a * b)'

Dual form
Find the dual form.

(a + b)' + c * a' + 1

1 + 1 * 0'
